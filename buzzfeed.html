<h2>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h2>
    <h1>Millenial Publicist Shifts from Finessing Fashion Runways to penning Buzzfeed Exposés</h1>
    <p>
       New York, NY -- July 20, 2018 -- Today Buzzfeed named Tyler Martin, formerly a publicist at KCD Worldwide, as the newest addition to their communications team. Although Martin’s experience is rooted in high-end fashion, working for nearly three years at one of the premier global agencies for luxury fashion brands, the skills and media awareness she brings to the role are reportedly that of a seasoned industry insider and are applicable to more than just the runway. In her new role, Martin will promote Buzzfeed content across numerous channels, create and maintain connections with top press, and collaborate with teams across the company to create a cohesive corporate narrative. 

“Although I don’t necessarily have the exact background that Buzzfeed might look for in such a role, I wanted to prove to the communications team there that I could think outside of the box and engage with the brand in a way that is thoughtful and relevant to the type of work I’d be doing in the future. Buzzfeed understands the future of journalism and how to survive in an age when magazines are publishing their last print issues. The industry is switching to digital, so I’d be stupid to miss an opportunity like this one.” 

According to Martin, she sought to work at Buzzfeed because of the opportunities there, but also because of the company’s culture and ability to infuse hard work with amusement. As a publicist, Martin will utilize her writing abilities and previous experience to amplify content, pitch stories, promote products, push for media coverage, foster stronger press relationships, research and grow company databases, and also support internal communications programs. 

In her most recent position, Martin was an account executive at Violetta Group, a start-up bicoastal agency where she managed 8 client accounts, including Ghost Vapes and iconic British lingerie brand Agent Provocateur. She developed the North American media strategy for Agent Provocateur’s Spring/Summer 2018 campaign, which starred a scantily clad Daphne Groeneveld. In addition to her work at Violetta Group, Martin also was a publicist at KCD where she organized photographers on the red carpet at the CFDA Award 2015 and 2016 shows, supported various NYFW runway shows and events, and tracked media coverage for prominent fashion clients like Isabel Marant, Alexander McQueen, Givenchy, and Fausto Puglisi. 

“Working at Buzzfeed would really be a journey back in time for me, going back to my start as a journalist at the Detroit Metro Times when I was constantly surrounded by an award-winning team of writers. I would love to step away from fashion and return to those journalistic roots. It was my focus in college and the first part of my career, and I know that this is a way for me to get back on my path while still working in PR.”
